# Digital Clock

This python script uses a Raspberry Pi and 30 NeoPixel lights to display current time.
The main library comes from Adafruit

It is developed to be hunged on a wall in the MakerHub room so, people in the room can see the current time.

The only file that's needed to run the clock is 'startlights01.py' the others are just for testing purposes
