# Digital Clock & Temperautre Display

This python script uses a Raspberry Pi and 30 NeoPixel lights to display current time and local weather temperature.
The neopixel library comes from Adafruit

It is developed to be hunged on a wall in the MakerHub room so, people in the room can see the current time.  
Ten (10) minutes before the MakerHub closes, a count down will be displayed from 10 minutes and 0 seconds down to 0 seconds.  This is to make participantes aware how many minutes they have left until the closing time.

The only file that's needed to run the clock is 'startlights00.py' the others are just for testing purposes
